    title: 'The case for local-first software: why we\'re building wrong',
    body: `For the past decade, we've migrated everything to the cloud. Email, documents, photos, notes — all of it now lives on someone else's server. But I've been thinking: what did we actually gain?\n\nLocal-first software challenges this paradigm. The core idea is simple: your data lives on your device first. The cloud becomes a sync layer, not the source of truth. Apps work offline by default. You own your data literally — not in the legal-sense TOS way, but in the "if the company disappears tomorrow, your files are still here" way.\n\nProjects like CRDTs (Conflict-free Replicated Data Types) are making this technically feasible at scale. Notion and Linear both use them. But mainstream adoption remains slow.\n\nWhat's holding it back? Is it technically too hard? Is there a business model problem? Or do users actually prefer the cloud's tradeoffs?`,

    title: 'Do we have moral obligations to future generations we\'ll never meet?',
    body: `This is something I keep coming back to. We make decisions every day that will have consequences for people who don't exist yet — energy policy, debt, infrastructure, climate.\n\nDerek Parfit spent his career on this. His "non-identity problem" is maddening: if we make different choices, different people will exist. So can we wrong someone by bringing them into a world that's worse than it could have been? They wouldn't exist otherwise.\n\nThe utilitarian answer seems clear — suffering is suffering, regardless of when it happens. But there's something philosophically uncomfortable about having obligations to non-existent people.\n\nWhat's your intuition here?`,

    title: 'Quantum computing in 2024: separating reality from hype',
    body: `Every year someone announces a "quantum supremacy" milestone. Every year the enterprise use-cases remain theoretical. I want to do a clear-eyed assessment.\n\nWhat quantum computers are genuinely good at right now: certain optimization problems, simulating quantum systems (obviously), cryptographic tasks. What they're NOT good at: running DOOM, replacing your laptop, breaking RSA encryption anytime soon.\n\nThe coherence time problem remains brutal. IBM's latest chips are impressive engineering, but error rates are still far from practical fault-tolerant computation.\n\nAm I being too pessimistic? What applications are you actually excited about?`,

    title: 'React Server Components: a year later — honest assessment',
    body: `It's been over a year since RSC went stable in Next.js. Time for an honest look.\n\nPros: The mental model for data fetching is genuinely cleaner. Waterfalls are easier to reason about. Bundle sizes for data-heavy pages drop significantly.\n\nCons: The boundary between server and client components is still confusing to explain to new developers. "use client" feels like a step backward to the pre-framework era of manually managing concerns. The debugging experience when you cross the boundary wrong is terrible.\n\nMy honest take: RSC is the right direction, but the implementation has real ergonomics problems that the ecosystem hasn't fully solved yet.`,

    title: 'Is long-form fiction dying, or just transforming?',
    body: `Publishing is in crisis — everyone agrees on that. But there's a more interesting question beneath the headlines about declining book sales: is the novel as a form dying, or is it just migrating?\n\nSerial fiction on platforms like Royal Road and Wattpad has audiences that dwarf traditional publishing. Web novels in Japan and Korea are enormous industries. Fan fiction communities sustain millions of active readers and writers.\n\nMaybe what's dying is a particular distribution model, not the appetite for long-form narrative. Or maybe these new forms are fundamentally different — optimized for different reading patterns, different emotional payoffs.\n\nWhat do you think? Are you reading more or less long-form fiction than five years ago?`,

    body: `The business model problem is real and underappreciated. Cloud-first software has a recurring revenue story that's easy to pitch to investors. "We host your data, you pay us monthly." Local-first's monetization is more complex — one-time sales, or sync services as an optional addon. It's harder to grow on that model.\n\nThat said, I think the deeper issue is that most developers don't understand CRDTs well enough to implement them correctly. It's a genuinely hard distributed systems problem.`,

The intuition that we shouldn't leave future generations a climate catastrophe doesn't dissolve just because different choices would produce different people. We can have obligations to "future people" as a class without tracking individual identities.`,
